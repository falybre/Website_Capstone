                How representative is your 2018-2020 dataset of current traffic
                patterns, especially considering post-pandemic changes in
                commuting patterns?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                While our dataset predates significant pandemic-related changes,
                our model architecture can be retrained with newer data. The
                fundamental relationships between spatial and temporal factors
                remain relevant, and our approach can adapt to evolving traffic
                patterns with continuous model updates.

                Given the 17,300+ incidents in your dataset, did you perform any
                analysis on data quality or potential reporting biases?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Yes, we conducted extensive data quality analysis, including
                distribution tests across time periods to identify potential
                under-reporting during certain hours. We found approximately
                3.8% missing values and implemented appropriate imputation
                strategies. We also employed cross-validation to ensure our
                model wasn't overfitting to any reporting biases.

                The concentration of incidents in Quezon City (50.37%) seems
                unusually high. Could this be due to data collection biases
                rather than actual incident rates?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                We considered this possibility and cross-referenced with
                population density and road network complexity data. Quezon
                City's high percentage aligns with its status as the largest
                city in Metro Manila (covering about 25% of the metropolitan
                area), its complex road network, and high traffic volume.
                Nevertheless, we applied normalization techniques to account for
                potential reporting biases across regions.

              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Our current model includes temporal features like day of week
                and time of day, which capture some seasonal patterns. Weather
                data wasn't available in our primary dataset, which is a
                limitation we acknowledge. For future work, we recommend
                integrating weather APIs and special event calendars to enhance
                prediction accuracy, especially for anomalous traffic
                conditions. <span class="presenter-name">Miel</span>

                How did you tune the hyperparameters for your XGBoost model, and
                which parameters had the most impact on performance?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                We employed grid search with cross-validation to identify
                optimal hyperparameters. The most influential parameters were
                learning rate (eta=0.1), maximum depth of trees (max_depth=6),
                and number of boosting rounds (n_estimators=200). We found the
                model was particularly sensitive to the max_depth parameter,
                with deeper trees improving accuracy but requiring
                regularization to prevent overfitting.

                Your model achieved 92% accuracy, but what metrics did you use
                to evaluate imbalanced classes, and how did you address
                potential bias toward majority classes?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Beyond accuracy, we focused on precision (74%), recall (98%),
                and F1-score (85%) to better evaluate performance across all
                incident types. To address class imbalance, we implemented class
                weighting, used stratified sampling in cross-validation, and
                optimized for F1-score rather than raw accuracy to ensure
                balanced prediction quality across all incident categories.

              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                We employed time-based cross-validation, training on earlier
                periods and testing on later ones to simulate real-world
                deployment. Additionally, we performed k-fold cross-validation
                with stratification to ensure consistent performance across
                different traffic patterns. Our test set included diverse
                temporal conditions (rush hours, weekends, holidays) to validate
                generalizability across varying traffic scenarios.

                What evaluation methodology did you use to compare XGBoost with

              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                We used identical training and testing datasets, feature
                engineering processes, and evaluation metrics for all models.
                Each model underwent hyperparameter optimization to ensure
                optimal performance. While XGBoost requires more hyperparameter
                tuning than Naive Bayes, we ensured a fair comparison by
                allocating appropriate optimization efforts to each algorithm's

                What insights did you gain about the most significant factors
                contributing to traffic incidents in Metro Manila?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Our feature importance analysis revealed that temporal factors
                (time of day: 35%, day of week: 18%) and location (28%) were the
                most significant predictors. Specifically, rush hours (8:30 AM
                and 6:30 PM) showed 35% higher incident rates than other
                periods. The strong correlation (r=0.72) between day of week and
                incident patterns highlights how weekend traffic differs
                significantly from weekday patterns.

              <div class="question-text">
                How do you interpret the correlation (r=0.72) between day of
                week and weekends in your findings?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                This strong positive correlation indicates that traffic incident
                patterns change significantly between weekdays and weekends.
                Weekdays show concentrated peaks during traditional rush hours,
                while weekends exhibit more evenly distributed incident patterns
                throughout the day. This suggests different driving behaviors
                and traffic management approaches are needed for weekends versus
                weekdays. <span class="presenter-name">Yuan</span>

                What specific insights did your spatial analysis provide about
                high-risk locations in Metro Manila?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Our spatial clustering revealed that EDSA, Quezon Avenue, and
                Commonwealth Avenue are the most incident-prone corridors.
                Specifically, we identified that intersections along these
                routes account for a disproportionate number of incidents.
                EDSA-Quezon Avenue intersection, for example, showed 180% higher
                incident rates than the average intersection. This suggests
                targeted infrastructure improvements at these specific locations
                could have outsized benefits.

                How did you rule out the possibility that your model is simply
                identifying general traffic volume rather than actual incident
                risk?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                We incorporated traffic volume data as a control feature in our
                model, which allowed us to distinguish between high-traffic
                areas and high-risk areas. Some high-volume locations showed
                relatively low incident rates, while others showed
                disproportionately high rates. This normalization helps identify
                truly high-risk locations rather than just busy areas.

                triggers alternative prediction models. Integration with social

                deploy your model in a production environment at the MMDA?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Implementation would require: (1) A dedicated server with GPU
                support for real-time processing, (2) API integration with
                existing MMDA traffic monitoring systems, (3) A data pipeline
                for continuous model updating and training, (4) A user-friendly
                dashboard for traffic controllers, and (5) Mobile-optimized
                alerts for field personnel. Cloud deployment would provide the
                necessary scalability and reliability.

                How would you address privacy concerns regarding location
                tracking if your system were to be implemented citywide?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Our approach uses aggregated data rather than individual vehicle
                tracking. We recommend implementing data anonymization
                protocols, adhering to data privacy regulations, obtaining
                appropriate permits, and being transparent about data usage. We
                can achieve accurate predictions using anonymized, aggregated
                data without compromising individual privacy.

                What are the limitations of your current model and what specific
                improvements would you recommend for future work?
              </div>
              <div class="answer-text">
                Current limitations include: (1) Fixed temporal patterns that
                don't adapt to evolving traffic behaviors, (2) Limited weather
                and special event data integration, and (3) Lack of real-time
                updating capability. Future improvements should include:
                developing an adaptive online learning approach, integrating
                multiple data sources (weather, events, road work), implementing
                a reinforcement learning component to continuously improve
                predictions, and creating a city-specific ensemble of models.

              <strong>Handling Difficult Questions:</strong> If faced with a
              challenging question, acknowledge the limitation, explain your
              approach given the constraints, and highlight how future work
              could address this gap. Remember, identifying limitations shows
              critical thinking and research maturity.
